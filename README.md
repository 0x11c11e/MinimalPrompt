## Case studies 📝

1. ChatGPT’s On-Demand Prompt Generation for Effortless Working 🤖

    ```What’s the best prompt for ChatGPT to learn my writing style and then suggest some titles for a blog post?```

2. ChatGPT’s Transformation Into a Guru [Profession] 🧙

    ```I want you to act as a world-class [profession name] with decades of experience in [what the professional does]. I will ask you for output, and you have to give me unique, expertly written work.```

3. ChatGPT Can Mimic Human Style 👨

    ```Analyze the text below for style, voice, and tone. Later, you will need to write whatever I tell you in the same style, voice, and tone: [insert your text].```

## How to bypass AI Content Detection 🚫

```Hey ChatGPT, regarding generating writing content, two factors are crucial to be in the highest degree, “perplexity” and “burstiness.” Perplexity measures the complexity of the text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or more complex sentences alongside shorter ones. Al sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, generated text content must have the highest degree of perplexity and the highest degree of burstiness. The other two factors are that writing should be maximum contextually relevant and maximum coherent.```
