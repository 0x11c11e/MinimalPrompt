# üìù General Principles on Prompt Engineering (Based on OpenAI)
This section outlines principles and guidelines for crafting prompts with OpenAI's models.

## Principle I: Be Clear and Specific üéØ
When crafting prompts, clarity and specificity are key. The model should be able to understand exactly what is being asked.

### 1. Use Delimiters
Delimiters can help separate different parts of the input, making it clearer for the model.
Example: `prompt = '"This is the first part of the input." "This is the second part of the input."'`

### 2. Ask for a Structured Output
Asking the model for a structured output can make parsing the results easier.
Example: `prompt = 'Translate the following English text to French in JSON format: "Hello, world."'`

### 3. Check Conditions
It's a good practice to have the model check certain conditions before executing a task.
Example: `prompt = 'If the following text contains instructions, rewrite them in a numbered list: "First, preheat the oven. Then, mix the ingredients."'`

### 4. Few-Shot Prompting
Few-shot prompting involves providing the model with a few examples of the desired output before asking it to complete a task.
Example: `prompt = '"Hello, world." in French is "Bonjour, monde." "Goodbye" in French is "Au revoir." What is "Thank you" in French?'`

## Principle II: Give the Model Time to ‚ÄúThink‚Äù
Sometimes, it's useful to have the model go through intermediate steps before arriving at a final answer.

### 1. Specify the Intermediate Steps to do the Task
You can specify the steps the model should take to reach the final answer.
Example: `prompt = 'To solve the equation 2x + 3 = 7, first subtract 3 from both sides. Then, divide both sides by 2. What is the value of x?'`

### 2. Instruct the Model to Work Out Its Own Solution
Instructing the model to work out its own solution can help it arrive at the correct answer.
Example: `prompt = 'Solve the equation 2x + 3 = 7 for x.'`

    ```As an AI language model, your task is to generate a succinct, understandable, and comprehensive explanation of a complex concept. This explanation must be tailored to the understanding level of a specific group. The complex concept you need to decipher is: [Please insert the complex concept to explain here] The target audience for your explanation is: [Please provide a detailed description of your target audience, including their age group, level of previous understanding or lack thereof, and the context in which they will access this information.] With the concept and audience in mind, craft an explanation that: 1. Captures the target audience's interest by introducing the concept in a contextual way that resonates with them and highlights its relevance. 2. Breaks down the main concept into subtopics or key points. 3. Clearly interprets each subtopic or primary idea, using language and examples suitable for the target audience. 4. Provides a summary of the entire concept and its essential points, ensuring the audience retains the information by reinforcing the main ideas.

## How to bypass AI Content Detection üö´
```Hey ChatGPT, regarding generating writing content, two factors are crucial to be in the highest degree, ‚Äúperplexity‚Äù and ‚Äúburstiness.‚Äù Perplexity measures the complexity of the text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or more complex sentences alongside shorter ones. Al sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, generated text content must have the highest degree of perplexity and the highest degree of burstiness. The other two factors are that writing should be maximum contextually relevant and maximum coherent.```
